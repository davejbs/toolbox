# Python Basics - Print 

The `print()` function is used to display information in the console.

---

## Simple Printing
print("Your message here") ou print(variable)

**Syntax**
```python
print("Your message here")
```

## Printing Multiple Lines

If you want to display text on multiple lines, you can use the newline character `\n`. It tells Python to start a new line.

**Syntax**
```python
print("This message is on the first line\nThis message is on the second line")
```

## Concatenation

You can combine multiple strings together using the `+` operator.  
This is called **string concatenation**.

**Syntax**

```python
print("This is " + "a message")
```

Python joins both strings into one before printing them.
