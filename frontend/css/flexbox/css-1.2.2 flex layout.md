# CSS Flex — Flex Layout

## What is it?

Flexbox allows you to build and customize **responsive layouts** using a flexible, one‑dimensional layout model.

Because Flexbox includes many properties, it is not practical to explain all of them in detail here.
Instead, this guide serves as a **reference entry point**.

## Recommended Reference

For a complete explanation with visual examples, refer to:

- [CSS-Tricks — A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

This resource explains Flexbox behavior more thoroughly than a short summary could.

## Viewport Units Reminder

Flex layouts often rely on viewport-based units:

- `vw` — viewport width
- `vh` — viewport height

These units allow elements to scale relative to the browser window size and are commonly used with Flexbox.
