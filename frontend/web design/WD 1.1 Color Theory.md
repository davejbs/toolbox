# Color Theory — Fundamentals

## What is color theory?

Color theory is the study of how colors interact and how they influence **perception, emotion, and meaning**.
In web design, color is not purely decorative, it communicates intent, hierarchy, and mood.

A good color choice improves:
- readability
- usability
- emotional impact
- visual consistency

## Why color matters in web design

Colors influence how users **feel** and **interpret information**.
They can:
- draw attention
- guide the eye
- reinforce branding
- create trust or urgency

Poor color choices, even with a good layout, can harm usability.
