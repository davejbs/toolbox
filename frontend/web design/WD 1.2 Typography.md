## Why typography matters

## General Rules

Some simple rules greatly improve typographic quality:

Breaking these rules is possible, but only with clear intent.

## Common Font Families

Typography can be grouped into major font families.
Each family conveys a different **tone, personality, and intent**, making it suitable for specific types of projects.

Understanding these families helps you choose the right font **based on theme and context**, not personal taste alone.
