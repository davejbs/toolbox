# Bootstrap — Components

## What are components?

Bootstrap components are **prebuilt UI elements** such as:
- buttons
- cards
- modals
- alerts
- navbars

They combine structure, styling, and behavior into reusable patterns.

## Documentation First

Because components involve markup, classes, and JavaScript,
the official documentation is the most reliable source:

- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/

The examples provided there are production-ready and well-tested.

---

## Why use Bootstrap components?

Components save time by:
- reducing boilerplate code
- enforcing consistent design
- providing accessible defaults

They are especially useful for prototypes and internal tools.

---

## SVG Icons

Bootstrap provides icons in SVG format.

You can:
- download the SVG file and include it as an image
- inline the SVG code directly in your HTML

Inlining SVGs allows:
- color control via CSS
- better integration with layout and animations

## When not to use components

Avoid Bootstrap components when:
- you need highly customized interactions
- performance is critical
- design deviates strongly from Bootstrap’s conventions
